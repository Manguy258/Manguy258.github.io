A Tribe Called Quest was an American hip-hop collective formed in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">1985</span> and originally composed of MC and
 main producer Q-Tip, MC Phife Dawg, DJ and co-producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad and MC Jarobi White,
 who left the group in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">1991</span> after the release of their debut album. White continued to contribute to the band
 sporadically before rejoining for their <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2006</span> reunion. Along with De La Soul, the group was a central part
 of the Native Tongues, and enjoyed the most commercial success out of all the groups to emerge from that 
 collective. The group released six albums between <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">1990</span> and <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2016</span>. The band broke up in 1998 after releasing
 their fifth album. In <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2006</span>, the group reunited and toured the United States. In 2016, they released their
 sixth and final album, which was still incomplete when Phife Dawg died suddenly in March <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2016</span>, and was
 completed by the other members after his death. Although the tragic death of one of the bands best members
 they pressed on and a good carrear. The list below show how I would rate their albums from a scale of 1 to 10
 where 10 is the highest and 1 is the lowest.

Here I am going to anaylize the important members of the group who I hold in the highest regard in rap.
I will be talking about Q-Tip and Phife Dawg and last but not least Ali Shaheed Muhammad. I will be talking about there 
solo carrear's however, in the end I will be rating the best member's through a bullted list.
<h2>Q-Tip</h2>
 <p>Q-Tip launched a successful solo career, which saw two sizable hits ("Vivrant Thing", and "Breathe and Stop"), and the Gold-certified album Amplified, released in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">1999</span>.
 The album was produced by Q-Tip and Jay Dee (as The Ummah), and DJ Scratch.After Amplified, Q-Tip changed directions and recorded 2002's. Kamaal/The Abstract, an album which saw him
 in the role of singer and bandleader. Unlike his work with A Tribe Called Quest, or his own solo work, Kamaal
 was constructed around live music, and "abstract" song concepts, all orchestrated by Q-Tip himself.
 Arista Records refused to release the album, fearing it would be unmarketable coming from a rapper, resulting
 in Q-Tip leaving the label. Undeterred, he recorded <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2005's</span> Open, a slightly more accessible album, 
 featuring contributions from Andre 3000, Common, and D'Angelo. After signing with Universal Motown Records,
 once again, the record was rejected by the label.He released the largely self-produced The Renaissance under
 the label in late <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2008,</span>. Kamaal The Abstract was released a year later on Battery Records. He also went on to do many
 production work woth the likes of Kanye and the Game which were other very prominant rappers in the rap game.
 <h3>Phife Dawg</h3>
 <p> The most notable of Q-Tip's critics was Phife, who took his former partner to task on his solo album
 Ventilation: Da LP, released in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2000</span>. DA LP was in my regards the best solo single to be relased by any Tribe 
member.The Hi-Tek-produced lead single, "Flawless", contained the lines "Go 'head, play yourself with them ho-like hooks
 sing ballads if it's all about the Maxwell look". Ventilation included production by Jay Dee and Pete Rock.
 Q-Tip and Phife soon patched up their differences. 
 Since then, Phife, who was diabetic, maintained a relatively low profile whilst recording his long-delayed 
 follow-up album, Songs In The Key Of Phife: Volume 1 (Cheryl's Big Son). He died on <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">March 22, 2016</span> due to complications 
 from diabetes.</P>
 <h4> Ali Shaheed Muhammad </h4>
 <p>Teaming up with two other artists from former groups, Raphael Saadiq of Tony! Tony! Tony!, and Dawn Robinson 
 of En Vogue, Ali Shaheed's next project was Lucy Pearl. The group scored two hit singles with "Dance Tonight",
 and with "Don't Mess With My Man", and their self-titled album was certified Gold a few months after its 
 release in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2000</span>. Following a dispute between Saadiq and Robinson, the latter left the group and was replaced
 by Joi; however, this new incarnation would only last for the remainder of touring.
Ali Shaheed then focused on developing a stable of artists, most of whom were showcased on his debut solo 
album Shaheedullah and Stereotypes, released independently in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2004</span>. In <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2013</span>, Ali Shaheed co-hosted the hip-hop
 podcast "Microphone Check" on NPR Music with Frannie Kelly. The show parted ways with NPR in <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">2016</span>. Ali
 in my opnoion is the one who held the group togother in the documantry about ATCQ it was said many times that
 he was the only thing that kept Q-tip and Phife from fighting.</p>
